Due to the short irradiation time, this segment might hence miss the tumour. If this effect becomes significant for a number of fields, the dose distribution shown in Movie 2 is no longer valid, since it is based on the assumption that all respiratory phases will experience the same beam/segment configuration. More realistically, the low-MU segments will only be experienced by some respiratory phases. If the “wrong” phases are associated with the segments, the dose associated with these segments will not contribute to the PTV dose, but still increase the dose to organs at risk."

Specimens that displayed extra-embryonic fluorescence were discarded. Note that the bulk of the fluorescent cells are situated in a mesodermal compartment characterized by robust primary vasculogenesis. Using this targeted approach any Mito-YFP fluorescent cells observed in circulation after HH10 had to have originated from mesoderm of the embryo proper, i.e., did not arise from extra-embryonic mesoderm.

Resistance was felt to wire operation for sheath insertion, and fluoroscopy showed that it was caught in the recurrent artery in the elbow region. After repeated reinsertions, the wire was successfully inserted into the brachial artery, and the sheath could be inserted. Subsequent contrast showed extravasation (arrow) and a subcutaneous hematoma, but manual compression prevented the hematoma from expanding. Ultrasound scanning at a later date confirmed that there was no formation of pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula. The damage probably occurred when resistance was felt during insertion of the wire. This type of situation can be expected if the wire is forcibly inserted into the recurrent artery, and treatment must be applied to ensure that the hematoma does not become too large."

ROCO_46928,a series of images showing the different stages of a cataract,"Horizontal transfoveal OCT scans obtained with averaging (3–10 scans) from the right eye of a 7-year-old girl with JNCL (top, Patient 1) and from the right eye of another 7-year-old girl with the same disease (middle, Patient 2). A comparable image from a healthy 7-year-old girl (below) is the product of the averaging of 30 scans. The number of scans in the two patients was limited by poor fixation. Both patients show unremarkable retinal nerve fiber layers, whereas the structures of the outer layers of the retina are severely disrupted. Assuming that the main loss of substance has occurred in the photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium layers, what is left of the retina may be interpreted as an isoreflective unit of the ganglion cell layer and the inner plexiform layer, which appear to be of normal combined thickness, followed by severely attenuated but distinct inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers. A thin outer nuclear layer is visible in Patient 2, but not in Patient 1, and farther out the remaining layers of the retina are reduced to a thin irregular hyperreflective layer. In Patient 1, epiretinal fibrosis is seen in the temporal macula."

There is thickening of the SA‐SD bursa (arrowheads) which is confined to the superior recess over supraspinatus tendon (s) and spares the bursal recesses elsewhere. This distribution reflects the zone of compression and is characteristic of chronic impingement but does not alone predict symptoms. Other forms of inflammatory bursitis usually result in a more generalised distribution of bursal change. A small bursal effusion may also be seen in acute impingement episodes, but this finding is non‐specific as other causes also exist (e.g. inflammatory arthropathies, polymyalgia rheumatica, full‐thickness rotator cuff tear). g = greater humeral tuberosity.
